# I Am Sure Trying


As the title says, I am sure trying. Admittedly, each day is a struggle. I try so hard. I've been accused of not trying, but I've been trying each day of my life.

I've been doing good work on the Electric Vehicle Conversion project and our faculty mentor on the project knows that I've been under a lot of stress. He really appreciates that I've been trying so hard, that I've been willing to contribute in any way that I've been able to, and that I've always been willing to learn new things during my work on the project while I've been stressed.

He's certainly willing to provide a recommendation for Stevens and this fall, he'd like to talk to me about my plans for Stevens and my career plans.

I've been feeling very tired from Quantum Summer School. It hasn't been the material that has been exhausting me, but it's been the jokes, the memes, and the chat. The chat has been horrific for me. There are over 200 people from all over the world in Quantum Summer School.

The video game repair company that I applied to was interested in talking to me, but ultimately, I couldn't get the job because I wouldn't have had enough work hours for training.

Here is a Reddit post of mine in which I describe how much difficulty I've been having: http://stevenkorvin.com/v7EroZ

I was a bit talkative during my COBOL class today. It was because I've been exhausted. Because Bergen Community is rolling out multi-factor authentication,I had explained my previous process of writing the backup codes from the sites that had supported them on business cards and putting them in a wallet. Also, I had maintained a local password manager database using KeePass. It wasn't long before that had failed on me. Now, I keep everything like that in 1Password. 

After that, the professor had asked if anybody has used hardware security keys. I showed him my Yubikey 5 NFC and my Google Titan key on my keyring. I then talked about my Trezor T, which I keep in my apartment and the MicroSD card  that I keep in my wallet that has the microcontroller unit's decryption key on it. The professor asked "What happens if you lose THAT?" I then explained that you wipe the device and you set it up again using your paper backup.  He then said "Okay. That makes sense!" Cryptography is so awesome. I also talked about how the Trezor T became useful when I had accidentally thrown my keyring in the dumpster last year because of stress.
