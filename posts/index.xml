    <description><![CDATA[<p>I wasn&rsquo;t into paying Squarespace to maintain a website, so I went with GitHub Pages and Hugo! It seems like it&rsquo;ll work. I already have a personal domain.</p>
<p>I had a very productive day on Friday. I was told that I &ldquo;looked very relaxed&rdquo; after completing my tasks that day. I need productive days more often and in order to experience them, I&rsquo;m going to apply for a job after this summer job with school will be over. Due to my productive day, I found myself able to give up fiction. Fiction makes me feel very sick; however, I&rsquo;ve kept consuming fiction because I&rsquo;ve been going stir-crazy. Without fiction, I&rsquo;d just be walking around my apartment all day. Consuming fiction has felt like a better choice than a day filled with pacing.</p>
<p>You might wonder what my productive day on Friday had entailed. Well, I went to campus as a recent graduate of Bergen Community College and I worked on the truck for the Electric Vehicle Conversion project that I&rsquo;m currently a part of. Our team got half of the truck&rsquo;s wheels turning! That was great progress! It was my first time seeing the truck. Campus has been off limits for so long.</p>
<p>These next two weeks will be work toward the Community Colleges Innovation Challenge that our team is a finalist in.</p>
<p>Otherwise, though, I bought a one-month subscription to TryHackMe for some infosec training and I started looking through O&rsquo;Reilly Media again. I have a subscription to it as a Bergen student. Yes, I&rsquo;ve graduated, but I&rsquo;ll be taking classes there during the upcoming academic year. I also bought a one-month subscription to Inoreader Pro so that I can look through my RSS feeds again. I&rsquo;m very satisfied with the various actions that I&rsquo;ve set up with IFTTT Pro to send things to OneNote.</p>
