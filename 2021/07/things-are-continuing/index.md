# Things Are Continuing


The Community College Innovation Challenge was a very rewarding and tiring experience. Everyone says that it would've been so much easier in person. They talk about "Zoom fatigue." For me, it would've been much more difficult in person. According to the Computer Science, Engineering, and Information Technology department's dean, our team's participation in the competition had created potential partnerships with Bergen Community College. The real focus of the competition was entreneurship. I'm not well-versed in business, but I have a very good friend who is. She'd be glad to potentially one day start a business with me.

I'll be leaving the Electric Vehicle Conversion project for a month to participate in the Quantum Computing Summer School with IBM Quantum. Bergen Community College will be paying for the course's tuition, though I'll be paying $100 that'll be refunded upon completion of the course. I'll be rejoining the Electric Vehicle Conversion project this fall.

Last Thursday, the team working on the other project that I participated in last year at Bergen Community, the Ethical Hacking project, presented. They did an excellent job. I'll probably get a chance to be a student intern again next summer. If the project will still be running, then I think that I'd like to rejoin it while continuing working on the Electric Vehicle Conversion project. This summer, I had to relax and prepare for the competition.

Starting on July 6th, I'll be participating in a mini-course provided by Bergen Community College named Introduction to COBOL Programming and System Z. July through mid-August will be busy for me!
