    <description><![CDATA[<p>The Community College Innovation Challenge was a very rewarding and tiring experience. Everyone says that it would&rsquo;ve been so much easier in person. They talk about &ldquo;Zoom fatigue.&rdquo; For me, it would&rsquo;ve been much more difficult in person. According to the Computer Science, Engineering, and Information Technology department&rsquo;s dean, our team&rsquo;s participation in the competition had created potential partnerships with Bergen Community College. The real focus of the competition was entreneurship. I&rsquo;m not well-versed in business, but I have a very good friend who is. She&rsquo;d be glad to potentially one day start a business with me.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll be leaving the Electric Vehicle Conversion project for a month to participate in the Quantum Computing Summer School with IBM Quantum. Bergen Community College will be paying for the course&rsquo;s tuition, though I&rsquo;ll be paying $100 that&rsquo;ll be refunded upon completion of the course. I&rsquo;ll be rejoining the Electric Vehicle Conversion project this fall.</p>
<p>Last Thursday, the team working on the other project that I participated in last year at Bergen Community, the Ethical Hacking project, presented. They did an excellent job. I&rsquo;ll probably get a chance to be a student intern again next summer. If the project will still be running, then I think that I&rsquo;d like to rejoin it while continuing working on the Electric Vehicle Conversion project. This summer, I had to relax and prepare for the competition.</p>
<p>Starting on July 6th, I&rsquo;ll be participating in a mini-course provided by Bergen Community College named Introduction to COBOL Programming and System Z. July through mid-August will be busy for me!</p>
