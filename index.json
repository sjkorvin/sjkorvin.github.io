[{"categories":["Bergen Community College","Electric Vehicle Conversion project"],"content":"As I just posted on my Hashnode blog, I need to stay occupied with things that are meaningful to me. I’m doing QubitxQubit’s Quantum Summer School held in collaboration with IBM on Monday to Friday from 12 to 4 pm. I’m also taking a COBOL class at Bergen Community College, also held in collaboration with IBM, on Tuesdays and Thursdays from 7 to 9 pm. Additionally, I’m continuing with the Electric Vehicle Conversion project and I’ll be on campus on Tuesdays and Wednesdays from 9 to 11 am. These things are all very healthy for me and they’re things that I want to do. In April of 2020, I had 1.44 BTC. How can I possibly HODL when I’m as stressed as I was? I spent it all in one night. COVID had nothing to do with that “mistake.” I was just feeling so much stress. I tried to do something about my stress and in November of 2020, I bought a car knowing that I wasn’t going to be able to pay for gas and insurance. I ended up selling the car. I was about to start a data science menteeship with a mentor from MentorCruise. I suddenly became very busy, though, and I felt that it would be better for me to take things at my own pace. I’m going to be prioritizing my mental health by staying productive.

Everyone says that it would’ve been so much easier in person. They talk about “Zoom fatigue.” For me, it would’ve been much more difficult in person. According to the Computer Science, Engineering, and Information Technology department’s dean, our team’s participation in the competition had created potential partnerships with Bergen Community College. The real focus of the competition was entreneurship. I’m not well-versed in business, but I have a very good friend who is. She’d be glad to potentially one day start a business with me. I’ll be leaving the Electric Vehicle Conversion project for a month to participate in the Quantum Computing Summer School with IBM Quantum. Bergen Community College will be paying for the course’s tuition, though I’ll be paying $100 that’ll be refunded upon completion of the course. I’ll be rejoining the Electric Vehicle Conversion project this fall. Last Thursday, the team working on the other project that I participated in last year at Bergen Community, the Ethical Hacking project, presented. They did an excellent job. I’ll probably get a chance to be a student intern again next summer. If the project will still be running, then I think that I’d like to rejoin it while continuing working on the Electric Vehicle Conversion project. This summer, I had to relax and prepare for the competition. Starting on July 6th, I’ll be participating in a mini-course provided by Bergen Community College named Introduction to COBOL Programming and System Z. July through mid-August will be busy for me!

It seems like it’ll work. I already have a personal domain. I had a very productive day on Friday. I was told that I “looked very relaxed” after completing my tasks that day. I need productive days more often and in order to experience them, I’m going to apply for a job after this summer job with school will be over. Due to my productive day, I found myself able to give up fiction. Fiction makes me feel very sick; however, I’ve kept consuming fiction because I’ve been going stir-crazy. Without fiction, I’d just be walking around my apartment all day. Consuming fiction has felt like a better choice than a day filled with pacing. You might wonder what my productive day on Friday had entailed. Well, I went to campus as a recent graduate of Bergen Community College and I worked on the truck for the Electric Vehicle Conversion project that I’m currently a part of. Our team got half of the truck’s wheels turning! That was great progress! It was my first time seeing the truck. Campus has been off limits for so long. These next two weeks will be work toward the Community Colleges Innovation Challenge that our team is a finalist in. Otherwise, though, I bought a one-month subscription to TryHackMe for some infosec training and I started looking through O’Reilly Media again. I have a subscription to it as a Bergen student. Yes, I’ve graduated, but I’ll be taking classes there during the upcoming academic year. I also bought a one-month subscription to Inoreader Pro so that I can look through my RSS feeds again. I’m very satisfied with the various actions that I’ve set up with IFTTT Pro to send things to OneNote.
