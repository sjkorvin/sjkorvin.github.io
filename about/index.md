# About


### I'm an eternal try-hard always looking to learn more and to do better.

#### I hope to soon obtain a doctorate in Computer Engineering, a private pilot certificate, and French citizenship through citizenship by descent. I also hope to eventually move to Vancouver Island and obtain Canadian citizenship.
