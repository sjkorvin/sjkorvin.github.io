    <description><![CDATA[<p>As I said in my first post, I dislike fiction. It&rsquo;s a story that I don&rsquo;t want 
to tell, but fiction was pretty much forced on me all my life. I live on my 
own now! Things are great! Shouldn&rsquo;t I have been able to disregard fiction as soon as I moved in to this apartment? The answer to that is &ldquo;No.&rdquo; I wasn&rsquo;t able to. When I first moved in here, I had no computer and no smartphone. I was at the library all day. The library was closed on Sundays during the summer, though. It was unbearable to stare at the walls all day.</p>
<p>Subscribing to 1Password after moving into this apartment had really helped me get things back in order. In August of 2019, I bought an iPhone SE. After the library would close, I&rsquo;d go to Starbucks. After Starbucks would close, I&rsquo;d be outside on some chairs using Optimum Wi-Fi until early hours of the morning. What I mean to say is that I&rsquo;d be outside on those chairs after running out of my phone plan&rsquo;s data allotment, which happened quickly.</p>
<p>My mother wasn&rsquo;t into helping me buy a refurbished ThinkPad. I&rsquo;m my own person, right? Thus, in September of 2019, I bought a used ThinkPad for $20. I stopped going to the library after that. In fact, I had to go to the library one last time after getting the laptop to create a Linux live CD. In September or October of 2019, I subscribed to Visible. Visible gave me unlimited hotspot data at 1.5 Mbps. It was very awkward when I had changed and forgotten my iPhone&rsquo;s lock screen passcode. I had to go to those chairs using Optimum Wi-Fi with my ThinkPad and my iPhone connected to it through USB to reflash iOS using iTunes.</p>
<p>Then, in October of 2019, I got my first refund check from school. I had given my mother the check after she had asked me for it. She didn&rsquo;t want to return the check after I had given her it! My mother was asking me &ldquo;why I had needed the money&rdquo; when &ldquo;I have everything that I need&rdquo; through my benefits. After a month of pleading from me, it was returned. I had to cash it at the bank branch that had serviced my school. I took an Uber there. Also, in December 2019, the paperwork had to be filled in to renew my apartment. My mother was convinced that it wasn&rsquo;t going to be renewed and she was very angry. These kinds of reactions had only served to mess with my mind further.</p>
<p>By spending my 1.44 BTC, I had actually made myself prepared for COVID. I bought a computer that I could do work on and I bought a wireless router. I had also subscribed to Spectrum for Internet service. I had a few months free as a college student, but they tacked on extra charges that I didn&rsquo;t ask for. It took a long phone call talking to three people who wanted me to sign up for Spectrum Mobile to get those charges removed.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve had plenty of opportunities to accumulate Bitcoin again since spending the 1.44 BTC, but I spent each time because of stress and my inability to give up fiction. Stress had contributed to my inability to give up fiction, but I was also cooped up in my apartment all day. My mother has been taking me for drives nearly every single day, which is very kind of her. I wish I could get out of here on my own time, though. What the hell am I supposed to do if I&rsquo;m in here all day, right? Well, I&rsquo;d consume fiction, which just made me feel sick. As I said in my first post, I had stopped with fiction after having something productive to do. That wasn&rsquo;t the only thing that got me to stop with fiction, though. I made an amazing friend in February of this year and having her around has sure helped me get past consuming fiction.</p>
<p>I suppose that feeling so far from my goal of applying to the Stevens Instutute of Technology had also contributed to my stress. In 2019, I learned that I had to take Pre-Calculus, Calculus, Physics, Chemistry, and Biology in order to best apply!</p>
<p>I will end this post by saying that it&rsquo;s very scary when you have no control over what you do. That awful, awful stress had left me with no control over what I had done. Hence, I can&rsquo;t really feel angry at myself because I had kept spending my Bitcoin. I didn&rsquo;t have control over my actions!</p>

    <description><![CDATA[<p>As I just posted on my Hashnode blog, I need to stay occupied with things that are meaningful to me. I&rsquo;m doing QubitxQubit&rsquo;s Quantum Summer School held in collaboration with IBM on Monday to Friday from 12 to 4 pm. I&rsquo;m also taking a COBOL class at Bergen Community College, also held in collaboration with IBM, on Tuesdays and Thursdays from 7 to 9 pm. Additionally, I&rsquo;m continuing with the Electric Vehicle Conversion project and I&rsquo;ll be on campus on Tuesdays and Wednesdays from 9 to 11 am. These things are all very healthy for me and they&rsquo;re things that I want to do.</p>
<p>In April of 2020, I had 1.44 BTC. How can I possibly HODL when I&rsquo;m as stressed as I was? I spent it all in one night. COVID had nothing to do with that &ldquo;mistake.&rdquo; I was just feeling so much stress. I tried to do something about my stress and in November of 2020, I bought a car knowing that I wasn&rsquo;t going to be able to pay for gas and insurance. I ended up selling the car.</p>
<p>I was about to start a data science menteeship with a mentor from MentorCruise. I suddenly became very busy, though, and I felt that it would be better for me to take things at my own pace.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m going to be prioritizing my mental health by staying productive.</p>
