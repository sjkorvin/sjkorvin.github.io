    <description><![CDATA[<p>As the title says, I am sure trying. Admittedly, each day is a struggle. I try so hard. I&rsquo;ve been accused of not trying, but I&rsquo;ve been trying each day of my life.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve been doing good work on the Electric Vehicle Conversion project and our faculty mentor on the project knows that I&rsquo;ve been under a lot of stress. He really appreciates that I&rsquo;ve been trying so hard, that I&rsquo;ve been willing to contribute in any way that I&rsquo;ve been able to, and that I&rsquo;ve always been willing to learn new things during my work on the project while I&rsquo;ve been stressed.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s certainly willing to provide a recommendation for Stevens and this fall, he&rsquo;d like to talk to me about my plans for Stevens and my career plans.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve been feeling very tired from Quantum Summer School. It hasn&rsquo;t been the material that has been exhausting me, but it&rsquo;s been the jokes, the memes, and the chat. The chat has been horrific for me. There are over 200 people from all over the world in Quantum Summer School.</p>
<p>The video game repair company that I applied to was interested in talking to me, but ultimately, I couldn&rsquo;t get the job because I wouldn&rsquo;t have had enough work hours for training.</p>
<p>Here is a Reddit post of mine in which I describe how much difficulty I&rsquo;ve been having: <a href="http://link.stevenkorvin.com/9mtNjw" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreffer">http://link.stevenkorvin.com/9mtNjw</a></p>
<p>I was a bit talkative during my COBOL class today. It was because I&rsquo;ve been exhausted. Because Bergen Community is rolling out multi-factor authentication,I had explained my previous process of writing the backup codes from the sites that had supported them on business cards and putting them in a wallet. Also, I had maintained a local password manager database using KeePass. It wasn&rsquo;t long before that had failed on me. Now, I keep everything like that in 1Password.</p>
<p>After that, the professor had asked if anybody has used hardware security keys. I showed him my Yubikey 5 NFC and my Google Titan key on my keyring. I then talked about my Trezor T, which I keep in my apartment and the MicroSD card  that I keep in my wallet that has the microcontroller unit&rsquo;s decryption key on it. The professor asked &ldquo;What happens if you lose THAT?&rdquo; I then explained that you wipe the device and you set it up again using your paper backup.  He then said &ldquo;Okay. That makes sense!&rdquo; Cryptography is so awesome. I also talked about how the Trezor T became useful when I had accidentally thrown my keyring in the dumpster last year because of stress.</p>

    <description><![CDATA[<p>The Community College Innovation Challenge was a very rewarding and tiring experience. Everyone says that it would&rsquo;ve been so much easier in person. They talk about &ldquo;Zoom fatigue.&rdquo; For me, it would&rsquo;ve been much more difficult in person. According to the Computer Science, Engineering, and Information Technology department&rsquo;s dean, our team&rsquo;s participation in the competition had created potential partnerships with Bergen Community College. The real focus of the competition was entreneurship. I&rsquo;m not well-versed in business, but I have a very good friend who is. She&rsquo;d be glad to potentially one day start a business with me.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll be leaving the Electric Vehicle Conversion project for a month to participate in the Quantum Computing Summer School with IBM Quantum. Bergen Community College will be paying for the course&rsquo;s tuition, though I&rsquo;ll be paying $100 that&rsquo;ll be refunded upon completion of the course. I&rsquo;ll be rejoining the Electric Vehicle Conversion project this fall.</p>
<p>Last Thursday, the team working on the other project that I participated in last year at Bergen Community, the Ethical Hacking project, presented. They did an excellent job. I&rsquo;ll probably get a chance to be a student intern again next summer. If the project will still be running, then I think that I&rsquo;d like to rejoin it while continuing working on the Electric Vehicle Conversion project. This summer, I had to relax and prepare for the competition.</p>
<p>Starting on July 6th, I&rsquo;ll be participating in a mini-course provided by Bergen Community College named Introduction to COBOL Programming and System Z. July through mid-August will be busy for me!</p>
