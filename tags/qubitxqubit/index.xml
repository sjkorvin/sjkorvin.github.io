    <description><![CDATA[<p>As the title says, I am sure trying. Admittedly, each day is a struggle. I try so hard. I&rsquo;ve been accused of not trying, but I&rsquo;ve been trying each day of my life.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve been doing good work on the Electric Vehicle Conversion project and our faculty mentor on the project knows that I&rsquo;ve been under a lot of stress. He really appreciates that I&rsquo;ve been trying so hard, that I&rsquo;ve been willing to contribute in any way that I&rsquo;ve been able to, and that I&rsquo;ve always been willing to learn new things during my work on the project while I&rsquo;ve been stressed.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s certainly willing to provide a recommendation for Stevens and this fall, he&rsquo;d like to talk to me about my plans for Stevens and my career plans.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve been feeling very tired from Quantum Summer School. It hasn&rsquo;t been the material that has been exhausting me, but it&rsquo;s been the jokes, the memes, and the chat. The chat has been horrific for me. There are over 200 people from all over the world in Quantum Summer School.</p>
<p>The video game repair company that I applied to was interested in talking to me, but ultimately, I couldn&rsquo;t get the job because I wouldn&rsquo;t have had enough work hours for training.</p>
<p>Here is a Reddit post of mine in which I describe how much difficulty I&rsquo;ve been having: <a href="https://bit.ly/2TGlxUg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreffer">https://bit.ly/2TGlxUg</a></p>
<p>You may be cautious of the bit.ly link and you may not like URL shortneners, but I want to see how the link performs.</p>
<p>I was a bit talkative during my COBOL class today. It was because I&rsquo;ve been exhausted. Because Bergen Community is rolling out multi-factor authentication,I had explained my previous process of writing the backup codes from the sites that had supported them on business cards and putting them in a wallet. Also, I had maintained a local password manager database using KeePass. It wasn&rsquo;t long before that had failed on me. Now, I keep everything like that in 1Password.</p>
<p>After that, the professor had asked if anybody has used hardware security keys. I showed him my Yubikey 5 NFC and my Google Titan key on my keyring. I then talked about my Trezor T, which I keep in my apartment and the MicroSD card  that I keep in my wallet that has the microcontroller unit&rsquo;s decryption key on it. The professor asked &ldquo;What happens if you lose THAT?&rdquo; I then explained that you wipe the device and you set it up again using your paper backup.  He then said &ldquo;Okay. That makes sense!&rdquo; Cryptography is so awesome. I also talked about how the Trezor T became useful when I had accidentally thrown my keyring in the dumpster last year because of stress.</p>

    <title>Prioritizing Mental Health</title>

    <description><![CDATA[<p>As I just posted on my Hashnode blog, I need to stay occupied with things that are meaningful to me. I&rsquo;m doing QubitxQubit&rsquo;s Quantum Summer School held in collaboration with IBM on Monday to Friday from 12 to 4 pm. I&rsquo;m also taking a COBOL class at Bergen Community College, also held in collaboration with IBM, on Tuesdays and Thursdays from 7 to 9 pm. Additionally, I&rsquo;m continuing with the Electric Vehicle Conversion project and I&rsquo;ll be on campus on Tuesdays and Wednesdays from 9 to 11 am. These things are all very healthy for me and they&rsquo;re things that I want to do.</p>
<p>In April of 2020, I had 1.44 BTC. How can I possibly HODL when I&rsquo;m as stressed as I was? I spent it all in one night. COVID had nothing to do with that &ldquo;mistake.&rdquo; I was just feeling so much stress. I tried to do something about my stress and in November of 2020, I bought a car knowing that I wasn&rsquo;t going to be able to pay for gas and insurance. I ended up selling the car.</p>
<p>I was about to start a data science menteeship with a mentor from MentorCruise. I suddenly became very busy, though, and I felt that it would be better for me to take things at my own pace.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m going to be prioritizing my mental health by staying productive.</p>
