[{"categories":null,"content":"I wasn’t into paying Squarespace to maintain a website, so I went with GitHub Pages and Hugo! It seems like it’ll work. I already have a personal domain. I had a very productive day on Friday. I was told that I “looked very relaxed” after completing my tasks that day. I need productive days more often and in order to experience them, I’m going to apply for a job after this summer job with school will be over. Due to my productive day, I found myself able to give up fiction. Fiction makes me feel very sick; however, I’ve kept consuming fiction because I’ve been going stir-crazy. Without fiction, I’d just be walking around my apartment all day. Consuming fiction has felt like a better choice than a day filled with pacing. You might wonder what my productive day on Friday had entailed. Well, I went to campus as a recent graduate of Bergen Community College and I worked on the truck for the Electric Vehicle Conversion project that I’m currently a part of. Our team got half of the truck’s wheels turning! That was great progress! It was my first time seeing the truck. Campus has been off limits for so long. These next two weeks will be work toward the Community Colleges Innovation Challenge that our team is a finalist in. Otherwise, though, I bought a one-month subscription to TryHackMe for some infosec training and I started looking through O’Reilly Media again. I have a subscription to it as a Bergen student. Yes, I’ve graduated, but I’ll be taking classes there during the upcoming academic year. I also bought a one-month subscription to Inoreader Pro so that I can look through my RSS feeds again. I’m very satisfied with the various actions that I’ve set up with IFTTT Pro to send things to OneNote.
