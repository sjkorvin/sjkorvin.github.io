    <description><![CDATA[<p>As I just posted on my Hashnode blog, I need to stay occupied with things that are meaningful to me. I&rsquo;m doing QubitxQubit&rsquo;s Quantum Summer School held in collaboration with IBM on Monday to Friday from 12 to 4 pm. I&rsquo;m also taking a COBOL class at Bergen Community College, also held in collaboration with IBM, on Tuesdays and Thursdays from 7 to 9 pm. Additionally, I&rsquo;m continuing with the Electric Vehicle Conversion project and I&rsquo;ll be on campus on Tuesdays and Wednesdays from 9 to 11 am. These things are all very healthy for me and they&rsquo;re things that I want to do.</p>
<p>In April of 2020, I had 1.44 BTC. How can I possibly HODL when I&rsquo;m as stressed as I was? I spent it all in one night. COVID had nothing to do with that &ldquo;mistake.&rdquo; I was just feeling so much stress. I tried to do something about my stress and in November of 2020, I bought a car knowing that I wasn&rsquo;t going to be able to pay for gas and insurance. I ended up selling the car.</p>
<p>I was about to start a data science menteeship with a mentor from MentorCruise. I suddenly became very busy, though, and I felt that it would be better for me to take things at my own pace.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m going to be prioritizing my mental health by staying productive.</p>
