    <description><![CDATA[<p>As I just posted on my Hashnode blog, I need to stay occupied with things that are meaningful to me. I&rsquo;m doing QubitxQubit&rsquo;s Quantum Summer School held in collaboration with IBM on Monday to Friday from 12 to 4 pm. I&rsquo;m also taking a COBOL class at Bergen Community College, also held in collaboration with IBM, on Tuesdays and Thursdays from 7 to 9 pm. Additionally, I&rsquo;m continuing with the Electric Vehicle Conversion project and I&rsquo;ll be on campus on Tuesdays and Wednesdays from 9 to 11 am. These things are all very healthy for me and they&rsquo;re things that I want to do.</p>
<p>In April of 2020, I had 1.44 BTC. How can I possibly HODL when I&rsquo;m as stressed as I was? I spent it all in one night. COVID had nothing to do with that &ldquo;mistake.&rdquo; I was just feeling so much stress. I tried to do something about my stress and in November of 2020, I bought a car knowing that I wasn&rsquo;t going to be able to pay for gas and insurance. I ended up selling the car.</p>
<p>I was about to start a data science menteeship with a mentor from MentorCruise. I suddenly became very busy, though, and I felt that it would be better for me to take things at my own pace.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m going to be prioritizing my mental health by staying productive.</p>

    <description><![CDATA[<p>The Community College Innovation Challenge was a very rewarding and tiring experience. Everyone says that it would&rsquo;ve been so much easier in person. They talk about &ldquo;Zoom fatigue.&rdquo; For me, it would&rsquo;ve been much more difficult in person. According to the Computer Science, Engineering, and Information Technology department&rsquo;s dean, our team&rsquo;s participation in the competition had created potential partnerships with Bergen Community College. The real focus of the competition was entreneurship. I&rsquo;m not well-versed in business, but I have a very good friend who is. She&rsquo;d be glad to potentially one day start a business with me.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll be leaving the Electric Vehicle Conversion project for a month to participate in the Quantum Computing Summer School with IBM Quantum. Bergen Community College will be paying for the course&rsquo;s tuition, though I&rsquo;ll be paying $100 that&rsquo;ll be refunded upon completion of the course. I&rsquo;ll be rejoining the Electric Vehicle Conversion project this fall.</p>
<p>Last Thursday, the team working on the other project that I participated in last year at Bergen Community, the Ethical Hacking project, presented. They did an excellent job. I&rsquo;ll probably get a chance to be a student intern again next summer. If the project will still be running, then I think that I&rsquo;d like to rejoin it while continuing working on the Electric Vehicle Conversion project. This summer, I had to relax and prepare for the competition.</p>
<p>Starting on July 6th, I&rsquo;ll be participating in a mini-course provided by Bergen Community College named Introduction to COBOL Programming and System Z. July through mid-August will be busy for me!</p>
